# <Portfolio Site>

## Description

This project is a portfolio website for projects that I have developed.  It is meant to be updated with more projects as I progress in my learning, and to be a representation to employers of the skills I have learned.  Among other HTML and CSS skills, this project was specifically intended to develop my skills with flexbox and media queries to create responsiveness with changing screen sizes.
